# RadiationExperiment

This is the second independent project I worked on following the beginning of my Skills Bootcamp in Data Science with HyperionDev.

This project involved creating and manipulating lists and dictionaries, allowing the user to add further data to the entries. 
The user is then provided with updated average and standard deviation levels for the radiation levels at each location.

While loops, for loops and try-excepts are used to help with the flow of the program.

The task was:

Create a program that will calculate the average and standard deviation
of radiation levels for multiple locations using Python loops.

1. Organise data into a suitable structure
2. Calculate the average of multiple data observations
3. Calculate the standard deviation, giving insights into data variability
4. Add functionality for the user to input new radiation levels
